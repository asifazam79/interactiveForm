# Interactive Form

1) Used Wizard form to build requested Redux form
2) Added Page names as User, Privacy and Done
3) States are updated on the page, showing values dynamically
4) Set the state of the page as highlighted tab
5) Adding/Removing/Editing a new page is edited. The core logic is written in InteractiveForm.js
6) To make form more accessible, Previous/Next page buttons are added to navigate to different sections of the form
7) Form Submission is handled at the end of Privacy page
8) All form validations are completed as per requirement
9) Page numbers and Name states are handled. A function is created to update Page names that can be added to all pages
10) A quick approach is used to fulfil all requirements. There is a lot of room for improvement but the idea is to provide the basic knowledge of form Handling
